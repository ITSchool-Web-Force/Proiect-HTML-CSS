               <h1 class="title">D-day - June 6, 1944</h1>
               <h2 class="subtitle">Background</h2>
               <p>
                  In the military, D-Day is the day on which a combat attack or operation is to be initiated. The most
                  famous D-Day took place towards the end of World War II when the Allied landings in Normandy marked
                  the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. Started on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 and codenamed Operation
                  Overlord, it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. Planning for the operation began in 1943.
                  In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception,
                  codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied
                  landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a
                  further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had
                  requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days
                  each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German
                  forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied
                  invasion. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower in command
                  of Allied forces.

                  Four sites were considered for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the
                  Pas-de-Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, it would have been possible for the Germans
                  to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected. With the
                  Pas-de-Calais being the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, the Germans considered it to
                  be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region. But it offered
                  few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas,
                  landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of
                  Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and
                  eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of
                  the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome through the development of
                  artificial Mulberry harbours. A series of modified tanks, nicknamed Hobart's Funnies, dealt with
                  specific requirements expected for the Normandy Campaign such as mine clearing, demolishing bunkers,
                  and mobile bridging.

               <h2 class="subtitle">The disembarking</h2>
               <p>
                  The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne
                  assault—the landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops shortly after
                  midnight. Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The
                  target 50-mile (80 km) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha,
                  Gold, Juno, and Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions,
                  particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking
                  the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal
                  tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous.
                  Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified
                  towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled
                  using specialised tanks.

                  Just after midnight on June 6, Allied airborne troops began dropping behind enemy lines. Their job
                  was to blow up bridges, sabotage railroad lines, and take other measures to prevent the enemy from
                  rushing reinforcements to the invasion beaches. Hours later, the largest amphibious landing force
                  ever assembled began moving through the storm-tossed waters toward the beaches. Most of the
                  Americans were packed into flat-bottomed Higgins boats launched from troop transports 10 miles from
                  the French coastline. Vomit filled the bottom of the boats, and as water kept rushing in over the
                  gunwales, the green-faced men had to bail this vile stew with their helmets. Though it was cold, the
                  men were sweating. Planners had divided the landing zone into five separate beaches. The British and
                  Canadians landed at Juno, Gold, and Sword beaches. The Americans landed at Omaha and Utah beaches.

                  Meanwhile, the German high command—in the absence of Rommel, who was home on leave—began to respond.
                  Hitler was initially unwilling to release the armoured divisions for a counterattack. When he
                  relented after midday, elements of the 21st Panzer Division drove into the gap between the British
                  3rd and Canadian 3rd divisions at Sword Beach and Juno Beach and almost reached the sea. Had they
                  done so, the landings might have failed. Fierce resistance by British antitank gunners at
                  Périers-sur-le-Dan turned the tide in late evening.

               <p>
                  On June 7 the beachhead consisted of three separate sectors: that of the British and Canadians,
                  between Caen (not taken) and Bayeux; that of the U.S. V Corps, between Port-en-Bessin and
                  Saint-Pierre-du-Mont; and that of the U.S. VII Corps, west of the Vire River behind Utah Beach. The
                  narrow gap between Gold and Omaha at Port-en-Bessin was quickly closed, but it was not until June 12
                  that the American corps were able to join hands after a bitter battle to capture Carentan. The
                  beachhead then formed a continuous zone, its deepest point being southwest of Bayeux, where the V
                  Corps had driven nearly 15 miles (25 km) inland.

                  Meanwhile, work had been proceeding pell-mell to complete two artificial harbours, known by their
                  code name, Mulberry, that were intended to off-load vehicles and supplies until the port of
                  Cherbourg was secured. An outer breakwater of sunken ships for each harbour was in place by June 11.
                  Floating piers, designed to rise and fall with the tides, were half-finished by June 19, when a
                  heavy storm destroyed much of the material. The Americans then decided to abandon their Mulberry,
                  while the British harbour was not in use until July. Most supplies meanwhile had to be beach-landed
                  by assorted landing craft, landing ships, and amphibious trucks (DUKWs).

                  The Normandy invasion was one of great turning points of 20th-century history. An immense army was
                  placed in Nazi-occupied Europe, never to be dislodged. Germany was threatened that same month by a
                  tremendous Soviet invasion from the east that would reach the gates of Berlin by the following
                  April. The way to appreciate D-Day’s importance is to contemplate what would have happened if it had
                  failed. Another landing would not have been possible for at least a year. This would have given
                  Hitler time to strengthen the Atlantic Wall, harass England with the newly developed V-1 flying
                  bombs and V-2 rockets, continue to develop jet aircraft and other so-called “miracle weapons,” and
                  finish off his killing campaign against ethnic and sexual undesirables.
