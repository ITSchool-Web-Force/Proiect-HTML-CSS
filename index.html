<h2>Home Page</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the official page of the british rock band, <span class="bold-text">The Smiths</span>.</p>
    <p>You can use the <span class="italic-text">Navigation Menu</span> above to find out what you want to know about the band. But in order to make it easy for to navigate on this web site, here are some details about each page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold-text">Home</span>: the main page of the web site, this is the page you are right now :)</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">History</span>: here you will find the story behind the band's origin, rise, evolution and split (unfortunatly).</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">Bio</span>: here you can read the bios of the members (before, during and after the band). The Bio section includes information about: Morrissey, Johnny Marr, Mike Joyce and Andy Roucke. Although, there were previous members with very short-term, the only one wich made "famous" is Craig Gannon, and you can find something about him, as well.</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">Gallery</span>: obvious, this page has photos during the band's existence.</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">Discography</span>: here you will find the complete discography of the band, including albums, compilations, singles, videos and and anything related to this topic.</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">Gigs</span>: even though they no longer play together in concerts (soooo sad), in this section you will find the places were they held their live shows.</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">Contact</span>: well, if you reached the final section, you can leave a feedback, send suggestions or even to reach out for anything else.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, I guess the final question is, why was this web site built? The reason is to promote the music this band has offered the public. In their 5 years of existence they contribute to the evolution of music. The main music men, Morrissey, singing the lyrics he wroted and Johnny Marr the guitarist who composed the music, have been on the spotlight throught their carriers.</p>
    <p>Give it a try :)</p>
