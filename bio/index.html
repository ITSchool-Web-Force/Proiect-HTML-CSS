<h3 id="morrissey">Morrissey (Main vocalist)</h3>
<figure class="figure"><img src="../images/Morrissey001.jpg" class="bio-artist-image" alt="Morrissey"></figure>
<p>Steven Patrick Morrissey, known professionally as Morrissey, is an English singer and songwriter. He came to prominence as the frontman and lyricist of rock band the Smiths, who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and dark humour, and anti-establishment stances.</p>

<p>Born to working-class Irish immigrants in Davyhulme, Lancashire, Morrissey grew up in nearby Manchester. As a child, he developed a love of literature, kitchen sink realism, and 1960s pop music. In the late 1970s, he fronted punk rock band the Nosebleeds with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. He formed the Smiths with Johnny Marr in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for their eponymous debut album. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark quiff and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums—Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead, and Strangeways, Here We Come—and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.</p>

<p>In 1988 Morrissey launched his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. He took on Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer as his main co-writers to replace Marr. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, World Peace Is None of Your Business, Low in High School, California Son, and I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, as well as his autobiography and his debut novel, List of the Lost.</p>

<p>Highly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of indie rock and Britpop. In a 2006 poll for the BBC's Culture Show, Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living British cultural icon. His work has been the subject of academic study. He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature—endorsing vegetarianism and animal rights, criticising royalty and prominent politicians. Morrissey has also held controversial views, such as supporting far-right activism with regard to British heritage, and defending a particular vision of national identity, critiquing the effect of immigration on the UK.</p>

<h3 id="johnny">Johnny Marr (Lead Guitar)</h3>
<figure class="figure"><img src="../images/johnnymarr001.jpg" class="bio-artist-image" alt="Johnny Marr"></figure>
<p>Johnny Marr (born John Martin Maher, 31 October 1963) is an English musician, songwriter and singer. He first achieved fame as the guitarist and co-songwriter of the Smiths, who were active from 1982 to 1987. He has since performed with numerous other bands and embarked on a solo career.</p>
<p>Born in Manchester, to Irish parents, Marr formed his first band at the age of 13. He was part of several bands with Andy Rourke before forming the Smiths with Morrissey in 1982. The Smiths attained commercial success and were critically acclaimed, with Marr's jangle pop guitar style becoming distinctive of the band's sound, but separated in 1987 due to personal differences between Marr and Morrissey. Since then, Marr has been a member of the Pretenders, The The, Electronic, Modest Mouse, and the Cribs, and he has become a prolific session musician, working with names such as Pet Shop Boys, Talking Heads, Bryan Ferry and Hans Zimmer.</p>
<p>Having released an album titled Boomslang in 2003 under the name Johnny Marr and the Healers, Marr released his first solo album, The Messenger, in 2013. His second solo album, Playland, was released in 2014, followed by a third, Call the Comet, in 2018. Marr's autobiography, Set the Boy Free, was published in 2016.</p>
<p>Marr was voted the fourth-best guitarist of the last 30 years in a poll conducted by the BBC, in 2010. Phil Alexander, editor-in-chief of Mojo, described him as "arguably Britain's last great guitar stylist". In 2013, NME honoured Marr with its "Godlike Genius" award: "Not content with rewriting the history of music with one of the world's greatest ever bands, the Smiths, he's continued to push boundaries and evolve throughout his career, working with some of the best and most exciting artists on the planet."</p>

<h3 id="mike">Mike Joyce (Drums)</h3>
<figure class="figure"><img src="../images/mikejoyce001.jpg" class="bio-artist-image" alt="Mike Joyce"></figure>
<p>Michael Adrian Paul Joyce (born 1 June 1963) is an English drummer. He is best known as the drummer for the Smiths, an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982.</p>
<p>Joyce was born in Manchester to Irish Catholic parents, and attended St Gregory's Grammar School in the city. While the Smiths provided Joyce with his first taste of success, he had previously drummed for Manchester band The Hoax and Northern Irish punk rock group Victim. Joyce was a member of The Smiths throughout the band's existence (1982–87). Immediately after the break-up of the band, Joyce and Smiths bassist Andy Rourke played with Sinéad O'Connor.</p>
<p>They, along with Craig Gannon, also provided the rhythm section for two singles by Smiths' singer Morrissey – "Interesting Drug" and "The Last of the Famous International Playboys" and their B-sides. Work with Suede, Buzzcocks, Public Image Limited, Julian Cope, P. P. Arnold and Pete Wylie followed throughout the 1990s. Joyce, Rourke, and Gannon reunited to work on a project with fellow Manchester musician Aziz Ibrahim (formerly of the Stone Roses and Simply Red), ex-Oasis guitarist Bonehead (as Moondog One), and Vinny Peculiar.</p>

<h3 id="andy">Andy Rourke (Bass)</h3>
<figure class="figure"><img src="../images/andyrourke001.jpg" class="bio-artist-image" alt="Andy Rourke"></figure>
<p>Andrew Michael Rourke (born 17 January 1964) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of the Smiths. He is known for his melodic approach to bass playing.</p>
<p>One of the most revered bass players in alternative music, Andy Rourke helped craft the iconic sound of the '80s with seminal band, The Smiths. Rourke spent his early years honing his bass and guitar skills at the tender age of eleven, before joining the funk group Freak Party alongside his school friend, John Maher a.k.a Johnny Marr.</p>
<p>It was Marr who introduced Rourke to The Smiths in 1982, and he replaced former bassist Dale Hibbert after the latter played just one gig with the band. It was obvious from those early audiences that The Smiths would emerge as one of the most significant alt-rock bands of the era’s British independent music scene. Rourke’s playing style, evolved from a fully cranked tone knob and pick, gave each record a distinct tone that still sounds fresh today.</p>
<p>Those instantly recognizable and undeniable iconic bass lines— from his funk solo on “Barbarism Begins at Home” to the rumbling beats of “How Soon Is Now?” which helped solidify the sound of The Smiths. Is it any wonder Marr declared Rourke’s playing on the The Queen is Dead LP as "something no other bass player could match”?  Before the release of their fourth studio album, Strangeways, Here We Come in 1987, The Smiths split apart.  Attempts were made to continue recording together, but in the end the group moved on their separate ways.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other members</h3>
<h4>Craig Gannon (Second Guitarist)</h4>
<figure class="figure"><img src="../images/craiggannon001.jpg" class="bio-artist-image" alt="Craig Gannon"></figure>
<p>Craig Gannon (born 30 July 1966) is an English guitar player, best known as the second guitarist in the Smiths. He is now a composer for film and television.</p>
<p>Born in Manchester, Gannon had played in bands with friends since he was 12 years old, and in 1983 joined Aztec Camera after replying to an ad in Melody Maker. In 1984 he briefly joined The Colourfield, and went on to join The Bluebells. After another brief stint in The Colourfield, when bass player Andy Rourke was fired from the Smiths in early 1986, Gannon was hired to replace him. Within a fortnight, however, Rourke was reinstated and Gannon moved to rhythm guitar, becoming the official fifth member, playing on the "Panic" and "Ask" singles and touring the UK, Canada and the US with the band. Gannon also played on the scrapped single "You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby", which was included on The World Won't Listen compilation album. After the tour ended in October 1986, Gannon was no longer part of the line-up. He played on a total of six Smiths' album tracks, all recorded in 1986. Gannon has been affectionately known thereafter as 'The Fifth Smith'.</p>
<p>After leaving the Smiths, Gannon joined Brix Smith in The Adult Net and Blue Orchids. He reunited with Morrissey at his debut solo gig and 1989 singles "The Last of the Famous International Playboys" and "Interesting Drug", but that same year saw him sue Morrissey and Johnny Marr for nonpayment of wages and over the degree of his involvement in songwriting (notably for "Ask"). The matter was settled out of court for the sum of £44,000. This amount included £30,000 for unpaid wages and £14,000 in legal costs. Gannon composed the music used on the Inside The Smiths DVD, released by former Smiths Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke. In addition to this, Gannon also appeared in and composed the music for a classic albums DVD of The Queen Is Dead – released in May 2008.</p>
