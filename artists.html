          his own place, Rob was one of the first hires.

        <p class="description">
          Specializes in fine line and minimalism, abstract & geometric art.
          Okan is originally from Istanbul. Some would describe his works as
          minimalist, or geometric. Whilst most of his tattoos often contain all
          those elements, his designs are something we cannot categorize in one
          or two standard tattoo styles.
