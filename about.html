          McCurdy got his first tattoo at the age of 15 after his parents
          honored a bargain that they would consent if he made the honor roll.
          The Superman logo was done for $180 at Tattoos by RC in Folsom,
          Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p class="career">
          Less than a year after launching his career, McCurdy moved to New York
          City. He had a hard time finding work at first, bouncing from one
          tattoo shop to the next. When he would show tattoo artists his
          portfolio, they had a hard time believing it was actually McCurdy's
          work because of how impressively the tattoos were done.
        </p>
        <p class="career">
          As demand for his work grew, McCurdy went to work between several
          tattoo parlors, including Last Rites and East Side Ink. When his bid
          for ownership was spurned, he made plans to launch his own shop, a
          move which ultimately led to his firing.[3] After about a decade of
          work around New York City, McCurdy opened Bang Bang Tattoo on Clinton
          Street in 2013, with investment money coming from his father.
